# Instructions

Each student is required to pick one of the following big data tools (where each one of them belongs to data storage, data access, resource management, data management, and/or data processing.). You are required to prepare a presentation that cover these concepts; the presentation should include a general introduction to the tool, why it has been used, when it should be used, where it should be used, what other tools this tool can work with or support, and an example/demo of how to use the tool in Hadoop ecosystem. Coordinate with the other students in the class and pick one of the following tools. Each student can present one or two of the given tools. However, no tool can be presented by two students. So, make sure that you are the only one who will present the tool and no other students has chosen it.

1. Apache Drill (https://drill.apache.org/)

2. Apache Zookeeper (https://zookeeper.apache.org/)

3. Apache Oozie (https://oozie.apache.org/)

It is hard to find one paper that cover all the concepts that related to each of these tools. Thus, you can use different websites, books, and/or papers to create your presentation.
